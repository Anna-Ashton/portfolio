### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was `exciting / encouraged / happy / apprehensive / overwhelmed /`  because `I am learning angular for the first time, but as we say, there is always a first time for everything. 
I was also lifted up by collaborating with great team @ianchege([https://github.com/chegeian]) and @littlephillips([https://github.com/littlephillips])
and created our first pull request.`
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more `excited / encouraged / happy /grateful /motivated` because 
`I am going to dive deeper into angular and have more pull requests that I believe will be successfully merged.
`

- I find the project to be `demanding / competitive / challenges me `   I need to `learn-efectively and fast / tackle all blockers and avoid postponing.` 
- My level of stress is `manageable.`
